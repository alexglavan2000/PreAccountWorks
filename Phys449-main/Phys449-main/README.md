## For each Homework submission

1. the only requirement for each homework submission is to have a `main.py` and `README.md`
2. if you have other files, scripts or python modules to include in your homework, you can do whatever you like as long as it's inside the `Assignment` folder
3. remember to include your `param.json` and data files, this makes sure your code can run
4. remember to always use a [relative path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44772007/when-to-use-absolute-path-vs-relative-path-in-python) when you read the files, this makes sure your program runs on another machine
